**What Is Bitcoin** 

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency developed in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike investing in traditional currencies, bitcoin is not issued by a central bank or backed by a government. And buying a bitcoin is different than purchasing a stock or bond because bitcoin is not a corporation. Therefore, the monetary policy, inflation rates, and economic growth measurements that typically influence the value of currency do not apply to bitcoin.
