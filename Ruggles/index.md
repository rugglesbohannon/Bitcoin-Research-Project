**Leading Question:**

Has media attention, adoption, and rejection of Bitcoin had an affect on Bitcoins market price?
 
**Main Data Sorces:**

Some of Yahoo Finance's data has missing values on 2020-10-09, 2020-10-12, and 2020-10-13. 
My research does not suggest that the market was under any unusual distress during these dates. These missing values were reported months after the market crash in March of 2020. Reports from the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-oct-9-134301485.html) and [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/issue/todaysheadlines/2020/10/09/todays-headlines) corroborate that there was no unusual market activity that would have caused missing data.

I validated the Yahoo Finance data by looking at [MarketWatch's](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-price-hits-new-record-clears-60-000-milestone-11615648314) list of major market events and comparing specific dates and prices from each source. Below I have included two bar graphs comparing major price milestones from Jan 2nd, Jan 7th, Feb 16th, Mar 13th of 2021.

**Project Concept & Methodology**

Cryptocurrencies have recently been receiving a lot of attention. Being highly volatile, hard to understand, created through mining, and apparently holding the opportunity for massive financial gains, these currencies are hard to not consider when thinking about the future of money. 

I will be focusing my project around Bitcoin. Bitcoin is one of the more popular Cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is a decentralized global cryptocurrency created by [Satoshi Nakamoto] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#:~:text=Satoshi%20Nakamoto%20is%20the%20name,devised%20the%20first%20blockchain%20database.) in 2009.
