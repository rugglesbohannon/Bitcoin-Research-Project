Some of Yahoo Finance's data has missing values on 2020-10-09, 2020-10-12, and 2020-10-13. 
My research does not suggest that the market was under any unusual distress during these dates. These missing values were reported months after the market crash in March of 2020. Reports from the Yahoo Finance and The New York Times corroborate that there was no unusual market activity that would have caused missing data.

I validated the Yahoo Finance data by looking at MarketWatch's list of major market events and comparing specific dates and prices from each source. Below I have included two bar graphs comparing major price milestones from Jan 2nd, Jan 7th, Feb 16th, Mar 13th of 2021.

**Project Concept & Methodology**

Cryptocurrencies have recently been receiving a lot of attention. Being highly volatile, hard to understand, created through mining, and apparently holding the opportunity for massive financial gains, these currencies are hard to not consider when thinking about the future of money. 

I will be focusing my project around Bitcoin. Bitcoin is one of the more popular Cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is a decentralized global cryptocurrency created by in 2009.


To give some perspective surrounding why Bitcoin specifically may be the focus of so much media and financial buzz, consider the following. In 2013, only a few years after bitcoins creation, a single bitcoin was worth ~$100. In today's crypto market, a single bitcoin is estimated to be worth ~50,000. 

I decided to use various types of data to delineate any connections between Bitcoins stock price and the media attention it receives. I decided to use various types of data to delineate any connections between Bitcoins stock price and the media attention it receives. I decided I would first look at Coinbase, a cryptocurrency marketplace. Their IPO occurred on April 14, 2021 (Wednesday). This IPO gained a ton of attention after their market valuation was released at $85 Billion. Because Coinbase is a market on which Bitcoin can be purchased and sold, I hypothesized that this valuation would have increased the stock value of Bitcoin. 

Below I have included a Plotly visualization showing how large this IPO valuation was in comparison to other crypto exchanges, along with two visualizations showing what Bitcoins stock price looked like when Coinbaseâ€™s IPO was released.
