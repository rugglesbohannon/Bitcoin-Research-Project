*Founding father of Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin*
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that got the popularity in recent years due to much price increase. The value of bitcoin has increased by **685%** in a span of year.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency based on the market cap and makes over 50% of the entire cryptocurrency world. It would be fair to say that the entire 
cryptocurrency market is highly correlated to Bitcoinâ€™s price movements. And we know that price movement of bitcoin is very volatile, visually we can see that on 
the graph of bullish and bearish bitcoin price below. 

In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, it is very important to implement some strategies to manage your cryptocurrency investments. Managing your investment 
well means that your portfolio is managed against risk. Keeping these things in mind, I am considering continuing my project on **Diversification of cryptocurrencies
in Investment Portfolio.** This means I will be analyzing what other cyptocurrencies you can hold along with bitcoin for less risk and good profit. 

**Data Description**

The dataset I am working will be from Yahoo finance and you can access it from here: [Bitcoin data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE1iTQEM3gqle4ifIZ0FxmNSrO2jLU8jHDLYEnM4DGZk4dCEd-VhKRedEtXl6B3t2wj_eoseVG3MVLDWtXR5JAlz3aI6aQAheKcsaQTuFuWYKJvZPD2RdG3mC41_VtyVCE2slSvx_iqysSqDrh8KBvPb6GpvOmdGVTfFMCBkWE0E)
It has different columns of data like high, low, open and close price. It has also got the volumes of Bitcoin sold in the market which can be of particular importance
when analyzing the price and quantity of bitcoin sold.
