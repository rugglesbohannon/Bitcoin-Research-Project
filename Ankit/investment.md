**What is Investment Portfolio**

A portfolio is a term that represents the collection of all investments you own across all types of investment assets. If you only own 10 types of coins and tokens, 
then your portfolio consists of only the 10 cryptocurrencies. It is much better to own different kinds of investments across different categories. For instance, 
having a portfolio consisting of a mix of cryptocurrency coins, stocks, and bonds.

**Risk in Investment**

Risk is defined as the possibility of loss that an investor is willing to take in exchange for the possibility of gains from his investments. Different types of risk
in the investment are described below.

* MARKET (SYSTEMATIC) RISK:Market risk is the risk associated with the overall performance of the cryptocurrency markets. Market risks cannot be eliminated. 
If you've been an investor in the cryptocurrency space since the start of 2018, you will understand that the cryptocurrency market is highly correlated to Bitcoin 
and each other. The entire market crashed at the start of 2018 after a tremendous run in 2017, and no matter which coins you invested in, almost all coins and 
tokens experienced massive losses. This is an example of market risk.

* Coin-specific risk refers to the isolated risk of a single coin or token in the cryptocurrency market, influenced by factors specific to the project itself. 
If for example, a project experiences a negative event (such as network failure or running away with investors' funds), then the coin holder that 
invested in that project will be a victim to the project-specific risk. Coin-specific risk can be reduced through diversification.
