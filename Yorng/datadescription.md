**Description of my Data**

This data is from [coinmaps](https://coinmap.org/) and it has a json file which includes the companies that are accepting bitcoin, the location of the places accepting bitcoins, bitcoin atm, etc.

**Issues with the Data**

There are some main problems about the data that is very hard to find more information about. For example one of the categories is default and it is very mysterious in what coinmap means by setting a category name to be default. 
I was curious to see what default actually are by searching the names of the companies in the default category and it ranges from clothing store (which could fall into the shopping category) and e-shops.
Furthermore, the data has a thing called created_on which is very ambiguous since the numbers are very different from timestrings and I am very curious in what the numbers mean. 

**Getting the Data**

In order to get the data, go to the tab that says "API" on the top of the page and copy and paste the link under get venue and there you will be able to grab the json file of the companies.
