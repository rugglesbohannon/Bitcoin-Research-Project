**What is Bitcoin?**

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-bitcoin/) Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that you can exchange, buy and sell without an intermediary like a bank. It is created using blockchain and it is secure since each Bitcoin is encrypted with a unique blockchain.

**Data Visualization**

Many places are starting to accept bitcoins as payment methods and this truly helped build the faith in bitcoin and allowed miners to be able to spend their coins and not letting their mining effort go to waste. Bitcoin apparantly takes a lot of computing power and electricity to mine. As more places and companies are accepting bitcoin, the world is slowly but surely shifting into a more crypto world. 

The main question that this plot is trying to tackle is where can I spend my bitcoins and on what can I spend it on?


The plot below shows the scatter map of the locations that accept bitcoin with the different colors representing the categories in which the bitcoin can be spent on.

**Miner Rewards of Bitcoin**

Bitcoin can be a very power consuming thing especially when you are using a lot of computing power to create the blockchains for bitcoin. However, it is a very rewarding process in which people around the world earn millions of dollars daily when combined together.

Does the total rewarded amount of bitcoin affect the market cap of the bitcoins?

Here is a visulization of the market capital of bitcoin over time.
