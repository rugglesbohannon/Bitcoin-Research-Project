**What is Bitcoin?**

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-bitcoin/) Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that you can exchange, buy and sell without an intermediary like a bank. It is created using blockchain and it is secure since each Bitcoin is encrypted with a unique blockchain.

**Project Idea**

Many places are starting to accept bitcoins as payment methods and this truly helped build the faith in bitcoin and allowed miners to be able to spend their coins and not letting their mining effort go to waste. Bitcoin apparantly takes a lot of computing power and electricity to mine. As more places and companies are accepting bitcoin, the world is slowly but surely shifting into a more crypto world.
