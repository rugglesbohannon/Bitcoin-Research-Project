**What is Bitcoin?**

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-bitcoin/) Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that you can exchange, buy and sell without an intermediary like a bank. It is created using blockchain and it is secure since each Bitcoin is encrypted with a unique blockchain.

**Project Idea**

Many places are starting to accept bitcoins as payment methods and this truly helped build the faith in bitcoin and allowed miners to be able to spend their coins and not letting their mining effort go to waste. Bitcoin apparantly takes a lot of computing power and electricity to mine. As more places and companies are accepting bitcoin, the world is slowly but surely shifting into a more crypto world. 

The main question that this plot is trying to tackle is where can I spend my bitcoins and on what can I spend it on?


The plot below shows the scatter map of the locations that accept bitcoin with the different colors representing the categories in which the bitcoin can be spent on.

**Further Explorations**


I would like to dig deeper on websites that accept bitcoin as payment method, but the data is very limited and I could not find any data on it. Furhermore a con for this data is that bitcoin can allow people to make anonymous transactions which would make it difficult if things are on the black market. However, I am determined to dig deeper to find more information about bitcoins rather than just visualizing its price over time.
