**What is Bitcoin?**

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-bitcoin/) Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that you can exchange, buy and sell without an intermediary like a bank. It is created using blockchain and it is secure since each Bitcoin is encrypted with a unique blockchain.

Question: Where can people spend all their bitcoin?

To find the answer to the question, I tried searching for the data and found it [here](datadescription.md)

The following graph shows us the various places where you can spend bitcoin around the world.

**Another Visualization**

This visualization shows us the concentration (heatmap) of the areas around the world in which the places you can spend bitcoin are.


**Comparison of the graphs of Miner Rewards and Bitcoin Market Cap**

Bitcoin is the only company to take the least amount of time to reach the 1 trillion dollar market capital value.

The simple law of supply and demand states that if the supply is high, while demand stays constant, the prices will drop. 

Does this apply to how much bitcoin is mined everyday?

Let's take a look at the graphs of bitcoin market cap and the miner rewards


This is the miner rewards graph:
